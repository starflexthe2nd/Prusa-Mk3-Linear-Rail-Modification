This is a custom modification project for the Prusa i3 MK3 that upgrades the stock motion system with 2 sets of MGN12 linear rails, improving rigidity, print quality, and long-term reliability. 

This was a fun hobby project, pieced together using parts I already had lying around. The result is a heavily reinforced design that boosts rigidity, theoretically improves print quality, and just looks cool. 
It's definitely overkill for the stock NEMA17 X-axis motors, but that’s part of the charm - if you ever upgrade to a 48v motor system the motion system definitely won't be the thing holding you back.

In addition to the motion system upgrade, the mod integrates:

The Orbiter V2 Extruder for better filament handling

Incorporates a CHC Pro High flow hotend for improved filament flowrate

4010 radial blower fans for improved part cooling

A fully editable Fusion 360 CAD model so you can tweak and overbuild your own version, too

How to Start
----------

Download or clone this repository.

Open the Fusion 360 file to customize or inspect the design.

Export the parts you need as STL or STEP for printing.

Assemble the components - Documentation WIP, please for now use the CAD model as a reference.

Note: This mod requires mechanical changes and familiarity with 3D printer hardware. Proceed with caution and at your own risk, you should have a deep knowledge with 3d printer repairs and upgrades, along with
an ability to modify, change, solder, or otherwise reconnect electrical hardware.

Thank you for your contributions to the open-source project, as without these designs, making the correct changes to the model would be a lot more difficult.
